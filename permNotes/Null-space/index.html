It\'s also about generalising components for other uses. \n\nTo be able to interface with a module in Haskell, we can do this\n`module MyModule\n 	( MyType, myFunction, ...) where\n	import YourModule`\n	\nMeaning we can filter the functions and types inside a module and extract exactly what we need.\n\nThe import issue:\nIf Module A relies on a function from Module B and Module C relies on a function from Module A then any small change in any module can ruin the system. Interfaces provide isolation of modules so that this is minimised. \n\nModules should ideally be thought of as **black boxes** in that we should be able to take them out and replace them with other [[black boxes]].\n\n## References\n1.

In order to do so, it must go through every single element in the list until it hits the first instance of A. A can have an index of 0, 1 or 2 but the worst-case scenario would be if A had an index of 2. For example, the list (C, B, A) or (B, C, A) are the worst case scenarios for this situation. \n\nFor the function `elem` which looks at a list of n-size and looks for some integer X, the time taken is $an + b$, where $a$ = time taken to check one item on the list and $b$ = the time taken to start the computation.\n\nSince $a$ and $b$ are constants that vary from machine to machine, we can simplify and say that the worst-case run time of `elem` is $O(n)$. \n\nLike how $f(x)$ can be interpreted as a $y = x$ graph, we can interpret $O(n)$ to be a $y = n$ graph to get this shape:\n\n![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-9af0710089dddf436c615c748d51d894)\n\nMeaning that the worst-case runtime can be described **linearly**.\n\n[[Formalising the big-O notation.]]\n\n[[Deciding which big-O notation to use.]]\n\n[[Looking at quadratic time functions]]\n\n[[Representing sets as lists]]\n\n## References\n1.

However, we pick $O(n)$ to represent the big-O notation for $f$ because it is the slowest growing one (i.e the most efficient).\n\n## References\n1.

The point at which you're in the curve changes but the actual graph as a whole doesn't. \n\nShifts on the demand curve occurs when factors other than price affect the market of a good. If the news said there's a gas shortage for example, the demand as a whole for gas would increase at every price point. This is related to [[factors of demand]] \n\nShifts on the curve are as a result of the [[factors of demand]]\n\nIf we move along a demand curve, the price falls according to[[The law of Demand]].

Therefore, we have to investigate marginal benefit and marginal cost in relation to input demand and output supply. \n\nSince this is from the perspective of an employer, the marginal benefit to something would be the amount of money the employer gains while the marginal cost will be the amount that the employer pays.\n\nSo: if an employer pays for one extra employee, whose wage is $500, then the marginal cost was $500.\n\nIf the employee can bring home 50 extra apples, each 1 dollar per apple then the marginal product is $50. By dividing the marginal benefit by the marginal product we get the marginal cost, which is the cost to increase the total quantity of products by one unit, 500/50, $10.\n\nIf a firm was to profit-maximize then the marginal cost = marginal benefit.\nMarginal costs and benefits are relative to what the marginal unit is. So we could be talking about another unit of input or another unit of output. Let's say we're talking about another unit of input.

A left movement is associated with negative numbers so we flip our intuition and associate it with positive numbers. So, when thinking about left shifts, think about adding and when thinking about right shifts, think about subtracting. \n\nSo in a demand or a supply curve, the graph shifts to the left if the (quantity/supply) increases, and the graph shifts to the right if the (quantity/supply). \n\nLet's look at the graph $y = x$ and the graph $y_0 = x-1$ in the positive quadrant. Then, given the same $x$,  $y_0 \u003c y$. Therefore, a shift to the right decreases the output if the graph is sloping upwards. Vice versa for a left shift.\n\nNow considering a graph $y = -x$ and the graph $y_0 = -x-1$ in the (negative $x$, positive $y$) quadrant. Then given the same $x$, $y_0 \u003e y$. Therefore a shift to the right increases the output if the graph is sloping downwards.

We also know that capitalists control the mode of production. So, relations of productions are actually the basis of power in capitalist societies. Capitalists can dismiss any worker at will, workers are at the mercy of capitalists. Therefore, by studying the relations of productions of a capitalist nation, we are also directly studying the relations of power. \n\nWhat does Marx mean when he says:\n\n\u003e\"The bourgeoisie cannot exist without constantly revolutionizing the instruments of production, and thereby the relations of production , and with them the whole relations of society.\" - Communist Manifesto\n\nWell we know that the instruments of production refer to machinery and capital. By changing the production process to increase productivity, we are displacing workers and changing the relations of production and therefore changing the relations of production. \n\nTo prove that the relations of production are power structures, we need to understand [[capitalist crises]]. When production becomes too much, the working class become at the mercy of the capitalists, who frequently lay off the working class during periods of 'bust' in the [[business cycle]]. \n\n## References\n1. https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/relations-of-production",title:"Untitled Page"},"/textNotes/Socialization-(Marxism)":{content:"# Socialization (Marxism)\n#theory\nCreated: 2021-12-09 00:31\n\nImagine we are making a pencil.

Then it accrues that power even more by forcing smaller enterprises to submit to them. They do this in 8 ways:\n\n1) stopping the flow of raw materials (because they usually own the raw material deposits)\n2) contracts with trade unions to only work with monopolized enterprises\n3) contracts with buyers to only buy with monopolized enterprises\n4) boycott\n5) closing trade outlets\n6) stopping deliveries \n7) systematic price cutting\n8) stopping credits\n\n\n## References\n1. https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1916/imp-hsc/ch01.htm Chapter 1",title:"Untitled Page"},"/textNotes/The-Selling-of-Labour-Power":{content:"# The Selling of Labour Power\n#\nCreated: 2021-11-11 13:28\n\nLabour power is an essential resource that drives production.\n\nCapitalism organises the supply of labour power through [[the Market]]. Under [[Assumptions under the competitive market model]], markets require free entry and exit, therefore under capitalism it is necessary for people to choose to sell their own labour or not.\n\nThese agents are only formally free (formally as in nominally) to enter the market, because if they don't then restitution awaits them.\n\nThe existence of a Labour market is not time immemorial. The Classic institution (as in the institution of slavery during the Classic era) of slavery meant that you didn't sell your labour, you were owned by masters.\n\n## References\n1.

There is both a supply and demand, where the supply is the savings and the demand is the investment. \n\nThe price of loans is the interest rate you pay which is where the bank makes its profits.\n\nIf the bank becomes monopolized, companies are at the mercy of interest rates set by the bank.\n\nSo, under the conditions of a free market, banks and industries tend towards monopolization.

Thinking about the [[business cycle]], when there is an expansion in economic activity, lots of goods are being produced. Therefore goods are available for cheap. This is excellent for capitalists who can buy capital for cheap to make even more goods and ensue profits. The capitalists then use purchased capital to create even more goods. There reaches a point of overproduction when there are too many goods in the market. Due to a large supply, goods can\'t be sold as profitably anymore so the rate of profit declines.\n\nDue to the rate of profit declining, businesses have to be shut down and workers have to be fired. \n\n\n## References\n1.
