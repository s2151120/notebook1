Banks and loans are subject to the free market much like producers and goods. There is both a supply and demand, where the supply is the savings and the demand is the investment.
The price of loans is the interest rate you pay which is where the bank makes its profits.
If the bank becomes monopolized, companies are at the mercy of interest rates set by the bank.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/textNotes/anti-capitalism/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/textNotes/anti-capitalism/</guid><description>anti-capitalism, a beginner&amp;rsquo;s guide Created: 2021-11-11 12:40

Suddenly, out of nowhere, animals became very complex very quickly and basically all major animal groups emerged. Before, animals were super simple. Every X years, new fossils appeared where X &amp;lt;= 20 million. 20 million years is quick compared to the gradual time scales of evolution.
Therefore, evolution does not have to be slow, it can be quick.

Capitalism is both historically and abstractly defined.
When judging an economic system, capitalism rests on three conditions.
[[Private Ownership]] [[The Selling of Labour Power]] The Existence of [[the Market]] Furthermore, absolute monopolies result in the death of capitalism. fuck capitalism.

When the capitalists face issues, it is because of &amp;ldquo;overproduction&amp;rdquo;. Thinking about the [[business cycle]], when there is an expansion in economic activity, lots of goods are being produced. Therefore goods are available for cheap. This is excellent for capitalists who can buy capital for cheap to make even more goods and ensue profits. The capitalists then use purchased capital to create even more goods.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/textNotes/combination-of-production/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/textNotes/combination-of-production/</guid><description>combination of production #theory Created: 2021-12-08 04:52
grouping a series of branches into one big enterprise:
smelting of iron ore to pig-iron -&amp;gt; converting pig-iron to steel -&amp;gt; manufacturing steel goods.
Each step usually has a specific company dedicated to it, but sometimes a single enterprise would own every branch.
In doing so, the final good can be sold at a cheaper price while maintaining profits therefore upholding [[monopoly]].

AKA a [[monopoly]].
[[Socialization (Marxism)]] occurs when production becomes concentrated and more and more people are pooling their labour to create products.
Assume however, that every individual creates and sells their own product. They own the means of production as well as the results of production. Then any surplus they make is theirs to keep. As well as this, they have complete say in the mode of production because they ARE the sole employer and employee.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/textNotes/Debt-Based-Money/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/textNotes/Debt-Based-Money/</guid><description>Debt-Based Money #theory Created: 2021-12-09 01:54
Debt can be used as money.
Bank run = event where people try get their money out of their banks but banks don&amp;rsquo;t have it.
So banks wanted to create a new type of money. One that is not physical.
1704: Promissory Note = a written promise to pay back an X amount of dollars. This is basically debt and equivalent to physical money.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/textNotes/Dialectical-Materialism/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/textNotes/Dialectical-Materialism/</guid><description>Dialectical Materialism Created: 2021-12-01 22:32

Understanding how guilds worked:
Association of skilled members who trained via apprenticeships.
Closed and had a monopoly over a certain good. For example, the blacksmith guild of Peckham where citizens of Peckham only bought tools from that particular guild. Issue with guilds is that they did not keep up with growing demand and population due to their closed system.
The divison of labour of guilds took place as follows: Every person in a particular guild had more or less the same job.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/textNotes/idealism/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/textNotes/idealism/</guid><description>idealism Created: 2021-12-01 22:59

Burghers were artisans who owned the means of production and also the result of production (blacksmiths, butchers, bakers etc.) and were situated between the lords and the serfs.
The discovery of America gave new opportunities for the middle class because it stimulated markets to new heights (commerce, navigation, industry) which facilitated the polarization of society into two camps: working class and capitalists.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/textNotes/imperialism-Lenin/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/textNotes/imperialism-Lenin/</guid><description>imperialism Lenin #theory Created: 2021-12-09 01:34

Productive forces is basically resources and machinery. The tools + the labour power (employable population).
So essentially, the mode of production is the economic structure. It is how the economy is structured. The relations of production

One way is through the [[combination of production]]
Another way is through high capital costs for starting enterprises. The higher the capital required to start businesses, the less businesses start which strengthen the preexisting enterprises.

Every non central bank requires to have X amount of physical money in stock so that ATMS can function.
Central bank stores all the physical money. It costs the Central Bank 3 cents to make a $10 dollar bill so selling it to the bank would mean that the Central Bank profits by $9.97.

Under [[What are the Relations of Production]], we established that the relations of production are necessarily involuntary. We also know that capitalists control the mode of production. So, relations of productions are actually the basis of power in capitalist societies. Capitalists can dismiss any worker at will, workers are at the mercy of capitalists. Therefore, by studying the relations of productions of a capitalist nation, we are also directly studying the relations of power.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/textNotes/Socialization-Marxism/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/textNotes/Socialization-Marxism/</guid><description>Socialization (Marxism) #theory Created: 2021-12-09 00:31
Imagine we are making a pencil. Let&amp;rsquo;s say a pencil consists of a wooden shaft with a lead pipe and a rubber held in place with a brass clip.
Imagine all the processes needed to take the timber, lead, copper and zinc to make the final project. Each process requires at least one individual giving some of their labour power.

The issue with capitalism is that it constantly requires revolutions with the modes of production in order to meet with ever growing demand.
The existence of industry itself was brought about with revolution: the steam revolution.
Marx talks about the need to constantly revolutionize the instruments of production (machinery) and as a result the relations of production are revolutionized.

Let&amp;rsquo;s say that a monopoly already has a certain amount of power. Then it accrues that power even more by forcing smaller enterprises to submit to them. They do this in 8 ways:

Labour power is an essential resource that drives production.
Capitalism organises the supply of labour power through [[the Market]]. Under [[Assumptions under the competitive market model]], markets require free entry and exit, therefore under capitalism it is necessary for people to choose to sell their own labour or not.
These agents are only formally free (formally as in nominally) to enter the market, because if they don&amp;rsquo;t then restitution awaits them.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/textNotes/What-are-the-Relations-of-Production/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/textNotes/What-are-the-Relations-of-Production/</guid><description>What are the Relations of Production #theory Created: 2021-12-13 22:09
What is a social relation? It is the connection between two people. They come in 2 types: voluntary and involuntary.
