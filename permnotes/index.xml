Linking [[Education]] and [[Regulatory Framework]] we can ask the impact of administrative efficiency on market efficiency, Since [[Education]] is about the employment of [[Innovation]] on a large scale, innovations can be made on the digitisation of financial statements, records displaying property and patents etc. As a result, a good education would result in such ideas being put into wide practice by an institution that would form a regulatory body.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/permNotes/aggregate-demand/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/permNotes/aggregate-demand/</guid><description>aggregate demand #econsem1 Created: 2021-12-07 12:43

When price is affected by supply and demand, the extent to which it is affected is denoted by [[elasticity]]

Defining [[the Market]]
Many buyers and sellers in the market. No individual buyer and seller is big enough or has the power to influence the price. Goods produced are identical. Freedom of entry and exit to the market. Buyers and sellers are independent and selfish. Clearly defined property rights. If these assumptions are true, the output is an efficient allocation of resources.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/permNotes/Austrian-School-of-Thought/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/permNotes/Austrian-School-of-Thought/</guid><description>Austrian School of Thought #econsem1 Created: 2021-12-01 01:58

Issues:
Substitution: [[substitution effect]] As the price of goods rise the demand for its cheaper substitutes will rise.

Modular Design Thinking about a piece of software made up of two components:

For example if you have determined that a function takes $2n$ seconds to return an input, $f(n) = 2n$ belongs in many $O(g(n))$ sets such as $O(n)$ and $O(n^2)$.

Education leads to [[Innovation]]. The knowledge brought by [[Innovation]] is then disseminated by education.
Strong basic education (primary and secondary) as well as decent specialisation (tertiary) are important for economic growth.
Education can be quantified when assessing either the quantity or quality. Quantifying quality: number of schooling years, pass rate, completion rate Quantifying quantity: literacy rate, % of population with a degree etc.
Education is the mechanism for generating innovation and then employing it.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/permNotes/Efficient-CNF-Conversion/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/permNotes/Efficient-CNF-Conversion/</guid><description>Efficient CNF Conversion #icomsem1 Created: 2021-11-13 18:45

Input demand is the demand for inputs of production i.e labour. Output supply is the amount of goods that people produce.
Demand is linked with marginal benefit, output supply is linked with marginal cost. Therefore, we have to investigate marginal benefit and marginal cost in relation to input demand and output supply.
Since this is from the perspective of an employer, the marginal benefit to something would be the amount of money the employer gains while the marginal cost will be the amount that the employer pays.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/permNotes/input-market/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/permNotes/input-market/</guid><description>input market #econsem1 Created: 2021-11-03 21:08

Originally, societies were subsistence based. Meaning, labour was at the bare minimum for survival and all that was produced was immediately consumed. The absence of surplus = the absence of exchange = the absence of a market (?).
Anyway, the development of productivity meant that people produced more than they needed creating a surplus.
Marx&amp;rsquo;s issue was that the surplus was taken by the ruling classes who did not actually contribute to the labour to earn it.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/permNotes/Marxist-Labour-Theory/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/permNotes/Marxist-Labour-Theory/</guid><description>Marxist Labour Theory #econsem1 Created: 2021-11-25 22:06

Adam Smith: The amount of labour that went into producing a good partly determined its value in exchange.
Ricardo argues another factor: land, determined price of output. More productive land = less labourers needed so landowners charged a higher price to rent the land to farmers.
The landlord does nothing to earn the surplus value.

Frameworks are structures: a set of rules that you follow. Regulation refers to management and control. Therefore a regulatory framework with respect to [[Market Efficiency]] refers to the set of rules put out by a government that businesses follow in order to have some sort of structure and order with regards to doing business.

Then we have to consider the shape of the average total cost.

Graph shifts to the left if we apply $f(x+n)$ on $f(x)$ where $n &amp;gt; 0$.
Graph shifts to the right if we apply $f(x-n)$ on $f(x)$ where $n &amp;gt;0$.

$U$ is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$ containing each $x_i$ If $W$ is a subspace of $R^n$ and each $x_i \in W$ then $U \subseteq W$.

Say for example I offer you milk and I offer you orange juice to drink for breakfast. Milk is more expensive than orange juice so you choose orange juice.
However, if the price of milk falls to below orange juice then you would pick milk. Therefore, when the price of a good falls, it is more appealing than its substitutes. Therefore less people would buy substitutes and more people will buy the cheaper good thus increasing demand.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/permNotes/Superstar-Phenomenon/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/permNotes/Superstar-Phenomenon/</guid><description>Superstar Phenomenon #econsem1 Created: 2021-11-26 00:28

In the case of the consumer as mentioned in [[Types of goods in relation to one another]], we see that if one good and another good are somehow connected (like a left pair and right pair of shoes), we say that the complimentary effect takes place (that is to say both goods are equally affected by the demand of one good on another).</description></item><item><title/><link>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/permNotes/The-Link-Between-Marginal-Benefit-and-Demand/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/permNotes/The-Link-Between-Marginal-Benefit-and-Demand/</guid><description>The Link Between Marginal Benefit and Demand #econsem1 Created: 2021-11-25 00:43
Marginal benefit =the amount of utility you gain by consuming the next unit of a good. If you will get a lot of utility then you will want a lot of it therefore the demand curve is equivalent to the marginal benefit curve.
Analogously, the marginal cost curve is equivalent to the supply curve.

They are actually the reverse of one another.
They both explain demand through the interplay of three variables: the price of a good, the demand and income levels.

Let&amp;rsquo;s say $ax + by + cz = 0$ represents some plane $M$ that goes through the origin.
Then $n = \begin{bmatrix} a \ b \ c \end{bmatrix}$ is the normal to the plane.
$M = {v \in \mathbb{R}^3 | n \cdot v = 0}$
$v = \begin{bmatrix} x\ y \ z \end{bmatrix}$
