Many buyers and sellers in the market. No individual buyer and seller is big enough or has the power to influence the price. Goods produced are identical. Freedom of entry and exit to the market. Buyers and sellers are independent and selfish. Clearly defined property rights.

Education leads to [[Innovation]]. The knowledge brought by [[Innovation]] is then disseminated by education.
Strong basic education (primary and secondary) as well as decent specialisation (tertiary) are important for economic growth.
Education can be quantified when assessing either the quantity or quality. Quantifying quality: number of schooling years, pass rate, completion rate Quantifying quantity: literacy rate, % of population with a degree etc.

We have a market which is made up of a group of people that earn $x$ amount in a year.
We have a good that they want to buy. The price of the milk drops from $y_0$ to $y$ but their incomes stay the same.
Since these people are agents who seek to efficiently allocate their income in a way that brings them the most pleasure, $x - y_0 &amp;gt; x - y$ and therefore more people will want to buy the good.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/permNotes/Income/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/permNotes/Income/</guid><description>Income #econsem1 Created: 2021-11-11 12:10

Since the productivity of goods can be thought of as [[inputs of production]] vs outputs, we want the inputs to be as cost effective as possible.

Input demand is the demand for inputs of production i.e labour. Output supply is the amount of goods that people produce.
Demand is linked with marginal benefit, output supply is linked with marginal cost. Therefore, we have to investigate marginal benefit and marginal cost in relation to input demand and output supply.
Since this is from the perspective of an employer, the marginal benefit to something would be the amount of money the employer gains while the marginal cost will be the amount that the employer pays.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/permNotes/input-market/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/permNotes/input-market/</guid><description>input market #econsem1 Created: 2021-11-03 21:08

Originally, societies were subsistence based. Meaning, labour was at the bare minimum for survival and all that was produced was immediately consumed. The absence of surplus = the absence of exchange = the absence of a market (?).
Anyway, the development of productivity meant that people produced more than they needed creating a surplus.
Marx&amp;rsquo;s issue was that the surplus was taken by the ruling classes who did not actually contribute to the labour to earn it.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/permNotes/Marxist-Labour-Theory/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/permNotes/Marxist-Labour-Theory/</guid><description>Marxist Labour Theory #econsem1 Created: 2021-11-25 22:06

Adam Smith: The amount of labour that went into producing a good partly determined its value in exchange.
Ricardo argues another factor: land, determined price of output. More productive land = less labourers needed so landowners charged a higher price to rent the land to farmers.
The landlord does nothing to earn the surplus value.

Frameworks are structures: a set of rules that you follow. Regulation refers to management and control. Therefore a regulatory framework with respect to [[Market Efficiency]] refers to the set of rules put out by a government that businesses follow in order to have some sort of structure and order with regards to doing business.

Then we have to consider the shape of the average total cost.

Graph shifts to the left if we apply $f(x+n)$ on $f(x)$ where $n &amp;gt; 0$.
Graph shifts to the right if we apply $f(x-n)$ on $f(x)$ where $n &amp;gt;0$.

$U$ is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$ containing each $x_i$ If $W$ is a subspace of $R^n$ and each $x_i \in W$ then $U \subseteq W$.

Say for example I offer you milk and I offer you orange juice to drink for breakfast. Milk is more expensive than orange juice so you choose orange juice.
However, if the price of milk falls to below orange juice then you would pick milk. Therefore, when the price of a good falls, it is more appealing than its substitutes. Therefore less people would buy substitutes and more people will buy the cheaper good thus increasing demand.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/permNotes/Superstar-Phenomenon/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/permNotes/Superstar-Phenomenon/</guid><description>Superstar Phenomenon #econsem1 Created: 2021-11-26 00:28

In the case of the consumer as mentioned in [[Types of goods in relation to one another]], we see that if one good and another good are somehow connected (like a left pair and right pair of shoes), we say that the complimentary effect takes place (that is to say both goods are equally affected by the demand of one good on another).</description></item><item><title/><link>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/permNotes/The-Link-Between-Marginal-Benefit-and-Demand/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/permNotes/The-Link-Between-Marginal-Benefit-and-Demand/</guid><description>The Link Between Marginal Benefit and Demand #econsem1 Created: 2021-11-25 00:43
Marginal benefit =the amount of utility you gain by consuming the next unit of a good. If you will get a lot of utility then you will want a lot of it therefore the demand curve is equivalent to the marginal benefit curve.
Analogously, the marginal cost curve is equivalent to the supply curve.

They are actually the reverse of one another.
They both explain demand through the interplay of three variables: the price of a good, the demand and income levels.

Banks and loans are subject to the free market much like producers and goods. There is both a supply and demand, where the supply is the savings and the demand is the investment.
The price of loans is the interest rate you pay which is where the bank makes its profits.
If the bank becomes monopolized, companies are at the mercy of interest rates set by the bank.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/textNotes/anti-capitalism/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/textNotes/anti-capitalism/</guid><description>anti-capitalism, a beginner&amp;rsquo;s guide Created: 2021-11-11 12:40

When the capitalists face issues, it is because of &amp;ldquo;overproduction&amp;rdquo;. Thinking about the [[business cycle]], when there is an expansion in economic activity, lots of goods are being produced. Therefore goods are available for cheap. This is excellent for capitalists who can buy capital for cheap to make even more goods and ensue profits. The capitalists then use purchased capital to create even more goods.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/textNotes/combination-of-production/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/textNotes/combination-of-production/</guid><description>combination of production #theory Created: 2021-12-08 04:52
grouping a series of branches into one big enterprise:
smelting of iron ore to pig-iron -&amp;gt; converting pig-iron to steel -&amp;gt; manufacturing steel goods.
Each step usually has a specific company dedicated to it, but sometimes a single enterprise would own every branch.
In doing so, the final good can be sold at a cheaper price while maintaining profits therefore upholding [[monopoly]].

[[Socialization (Marxism)]] occurs when production becomes concentrated and more and more people are pooling their labour to create products.
Assume however, that every individual creates and sells their own product. They own the means of production as well as the results of production. Then any surplus they make is theirs to keep.
